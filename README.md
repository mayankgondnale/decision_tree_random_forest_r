# Wine Quality Prediction in R

Wine Quality prediction is a classic case of multiclass classification wherein the aim is to predict the quality of wine based on the multiple physiochemical factors and sensory test results which act as the independent variables. A thing worth noting is that the relationship between these two are very complex and not yet fully understood. This study aims at trying to understand this relationship and thus predict the Wine Quality.

The data is obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and is openly available to use for everyone from - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality

The data consists of 12 columns of which 11 will act as the independent variables and one will act as the dependent variable.

Dependent variable - 'quality' (The quality of wine based on sensory data. The value ranges from 0 to 10 with 0 being the worst and 10 being the best.

Independent variables - fixed acidity; volatile acidity; citric acid; residual sugar; chlorides; free sulfur dioxide; total sulfur dioxide; density; pH; sulphates; alcohol
